Smart Decathlon for Pros was a competition launched in 2021 to jumpstart consumer demand and ramp up sales of high-performance homes. Building on the success of the <a href="https://www.solardecathlon.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Department of Energy's Solar Decathlon</a> competition for students, this program was focused on professional builders. You can read more about <a href="https://www.eeba.org/smart-decathlon-for-innovative-professionals-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SDiPro at the Energy & Environmental Builders Alliance website.</a>

I created the brand for SDiPro and developed a web presence for the competition.
