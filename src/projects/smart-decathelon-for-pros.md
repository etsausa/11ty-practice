Smart Decathlon for Pros was a competition launched in 2021 to jumpstart consumer demand and ramp up sales of high-performance homes. It was a spin-off of the [Department of Energy's Solar Decathlon](https://www.solardecathlon.gov/) competition for students, except this program was focused on professional builders.
